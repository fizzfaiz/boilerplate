## Attributes

Attributes that can be used with this component :

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | null | Input name (required) |
| check | boolean | true | If true, will show the popover with requirements |
| length | integer | 8 | Minimum password length |
| label | string | name | Input label, can be a translation string |
| help | string | null | Help message that will be displayed under the input field |
| group-class | string | null | Additionnal class that will be added to form-group | 
| group-id | string | null | ID that will be added to form-group | 

All of the attributes that are not in the list above will be added as attributes to the input field :

```html
<x-boilerplate::password name="example" data-toggle="tooltip" data-title="Tooltip content" />
```

**NB** : for non primitive values that not using a simple string you have to use the `:` character as a prefix :

```html
<x-boilerplate::password name="example" :placeholder="__('stringToTranslate')"/>
```

## Password validation rule

To validate the field that will be posted when using this component, you can use the rule `Sebastienheyd\Boilerplate\Rules\Password`.

You can set the password required length by passing the value to the constructor.

```php
use Sebastienheyd\Boilerplate\Rules\Password;

$this->validate($request, [
    'password'              => ['nullable', new Password(8)],
    'password_confirmation' => 'same:password',
]);
```

## Laravel 6

Laravel 6 does not support Blade x components, but you can use the `@component` directive instead :

```html
@component('boilerplate::password', ['name' => 'example', 'label' => 'Example']) @endcomponent
```
